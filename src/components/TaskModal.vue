Your Vue.js component code mostly looks correct, but there are a couple of things to note:

Props Declaration: You are using defineProps to declare the isModalActive prop. This is generally correct, but the syntax can be a bit different depending on how you want to define your props. If isModalActive is a Boolean, you might want to define it more explicitly:

javascript
Copy code
const props = defineProps({
  isModalActive: Boolean
})
This way, you can provide type checking and default values if needed.

Usage of Props: In your template, you correctly use v-show="isModalActive". This will show or hide the modal based on the value of isModalActive. Just make sure that isModalActive is correctly passed as a prop from the parent component.

Styling and Layout: Your CSS seems fine for a basic modal layout. The modal will be centered on the screen with a semi-transparent black background. The modal itself has a minimum width and a border. You might want to add more styles for the modal contents, buttons, and inputs, depending on your design requirements.

Form Handling: Your form currently has an input and a save button, but there's no action or method defined for the form. Depending on your requirements, you might want to add a v-on:submit handler to process the form data.

Closing the Modal: You have a close button, but there's no event handler attached to it. You might want to add a click event handler to change the isModalActive prop or emit an event to the parent component to close the modal.

Accessibility Considerations: Ensure that your modal is accessible. This includes proper keyboard navigation, focus management, and aria attributes for screen readers.

Here's a revised version with some of these considerations:

vue
Copy code
<script setup>
import {  emit } from 'vue';

const props = defineProps({
  isModalActive: Boolean
});

const closeModal = () => {
  emit('update:isModalActive', false);
};

</script>

<template >
  <div class="modal__container" @click.self="closeModal">
    <div class="modal">
      <div>
        <h2>New Task</h2> 
        <button class="modal__close-btn" @click="closeModal">Close</button>
      </div>
      <form @submit.prevent="handleSubmit">
        <label for="detail">Description</label>
        <input type="text" class="task-detail" name="detail">
        <button type="submit" class="modal__save-btn">Save</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.modal__container {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left:0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
    border: solid 1px blue;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

.modal {
    min-width: 20rem;
    border: solid 1px salmon;
}

.modal__save-btn {
    display: block;
    border-radius: 5px;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 0.5rem;
    background-color: var(--green);
    color: white;
    width: 100%;
}


h2 {
    color: var(--light);
}
</style>
